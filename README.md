If you're a Node Operator in CSM, you get staking rewards as a part of Lido
protocol fees.

The allocation of rewards for CSM operators using a Merkle tree is provided by
CSM Performance Oracle once in a frame, making a new portion of the rewards
available for claim.

Here you can find the latest [rewards tree](./tree.json) as well as the
pre-generated [proofs](./proofs.json) for your convenience.
